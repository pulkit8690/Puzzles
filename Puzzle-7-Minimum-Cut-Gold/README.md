# Puzzle-7-Minimum-Cut-Gold

An employee works for an employer for 7 days. The employer has a gold rod of 7 units. How does the employer pay to the employee, so that the number of employee’s rod units increases by one at the end of each day? After the end of the day employee’s can’t spend any part of rod. How much minimum cuts in rod are required?


Solution:

Divide Rod into 3 parts A(1kg), B(2kg), C(4kg)

Day1- Give A(1kg)
Day2- Take A(1kg) Give B(2kg) 
Day3- Give A(1kg)
Day4- Take A(1kg) and B(2kg) Give C(4kg)
Day5- Give A(1kg)
Day6- Take A(1kg) Give B(2kg) 
Day7- Give A(1kg)

Hence we need to make minimum 2 cuts in the rod
