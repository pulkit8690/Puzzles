# Five-Litre-Three-Litre

With the help of two buckets and a water tap, a specific amount of water must be measured. One bucket holds 5 liters and the other bucket holds 3 liters. Both containers are lacking measurement indicators.

How can you measure a liquid amount of 4 liters using only these two buckets?

Solution:

First, you fill up the 5 liter bucket and pour 3 liters out of it into the 3 liter bucket. You now have 2 liters in the 5 liter bucket.
Empty the 3 liter bucket.
Pour the 2 liters into the now empty 3 liter bucket.
Next, fill up the 5 liter bucket and pour 1 liter out of it into the 3 liter bucket in order to fill up this container. 
Finally, the larger bucket now contains exactly 4 liters!
