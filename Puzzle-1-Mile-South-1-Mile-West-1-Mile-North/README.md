# Puzzle-1-Mile-South-1-Mile-West-1-Mile-North


The riddle asks where a person would be if they walk one mile south, one mile west, and one mile north, ending up back where they started. The video explains different solutions to this riddle.

The first solution is the North Pole, where walking in the specified directions forms a triangular path that leads back to the starting point. However, there are additional solutions involving circles near the South Pole. For example, starting one mile north of a specific circle and following the directions will lead back to the starting point. This creates an infinite number of possible starting points along that circle.

The concept is extended to circles with different circumferences, such as one-half mile or one over n miles. In each case, starting one mile north of the circle and following the directions will result in an infinite number of valid starting points along the corresponding circle.

In summary, the riddle has multiple solutions: the North Pole, an infinite number of points one mile north of a specific circle, and an infinite number of points one mile north of circles with different circumferences.
